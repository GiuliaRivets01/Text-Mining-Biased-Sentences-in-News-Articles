### Text Mining Final Assignment
This was the final assignment for the course *Text Mining*.

## Task
For this assignment, we have perforned bias detection in news articles. We compared classical machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVC) and a simple deep neural network trained on various text encodings (Doc2Vec, TF- IDF, Word2Vec, SBERT). Moreover, we introduced an explainability pipeline by employing SHAP.
